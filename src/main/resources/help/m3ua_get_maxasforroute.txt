Name
    m3ua get maxasforroute
SYNOPSIS
    m3ua get maxasforroute stackname <stack-name>
DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to retrieve the current settings of the parameter
    'maxasforroute'. The 'maxasforroute' parameter is used to specify
    the maximum routes for destination point code.
    Every destination point code should be configured in M3UA with the
    corresponding AS. The parameter 'maxasforroute' controls the
    maximum number of AS that can be used to route the message to the
    same Destination Point Code.
    It is better to always maintain this parameter as an even number for better
    load-sharing and a maximum of 2 is standard and widely accepted. You should
    not change this value if there is at least one route defined, else it will
    throw Exception for that route. You have to delete all the routes,
    change this property and redefine routes.
    The settings can be modified only when the M3UA Stack is not running.
    To modify this parameter you must invoke the setter function
    directly from the code or if you are using the JBoss AS, you can add a
    property to the XML descriptor file jboss-beans.xml. You cannot change the
    settings through the CLI.
