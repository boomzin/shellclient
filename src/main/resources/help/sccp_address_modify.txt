SYNOPSIS
    sccp address modify <id> address-indicator <address-indicator> point-code <point-code> subsystem-number <subsystem-number> translation-type <translation-type> numbering-plan <numbering-plan> nature-of-address-indicator <nature-of-address-indicator> digits <digits> stackname <stack-name>
DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to modify the values of an address previously defined.
PARAMETERS
    Standard Parameters
    <id>    -    Identifier of the address to be modified.
    Optional Parameters
    <address-indicator>    -    The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP
        Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
        length. Its function is to indicate which
        information elements are present so that the
        address can be interpreted. In other words, it
        indicates the type of addressing information that
        is to be found in the address field. The
        addressing information from the original global
        title is then compared with the passed address
        information to match the rule.
        SCCP ADDRESS INDICATOR
        --------------------------------
        | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 |3 | 2 | 1 |
        --------------------------------
        Bit '1': PC Indicator
            (1 = included)
        Bit '2': SSN Indicator
            (1 = included)
        Bit '3 - 6' : GT Indicator
            (0000 = GT not included)
            (0001 = GT includes
            Nature of Address)
            (0010 = GT includes
            Translation Type)
            (0011 = GT includes
            Translation Type,
            Numbering Plan and
            Encoding Scheme)
            (0100 = GT includes
            Translation Type,
            Numbering Plan and
            Encoding Scheme and
            Nature of Address)
        Bit '7' : Routing Indicator
            (0 = Route on GT,
            1 = Route on PC + SSN)
        Bit '8' : Reserved for National use.

        Only two fields of Address Indicator is used now for GTT:
        - GT Indicator (this is used for GlobalTitle type that
            will be created)
        - Routing Indicator bit (0 = Route on GT, 1 = Route on
            PC + SSN)
        GT Indicator for ITU-T network that is mostly used is -
        0100 (GT includes Translation Type, Numbering Plan and
        Encoding Scheme and Nature of Address). Digital value
        for it is - 16.
        For 0100 GT Indicator we will use two possible values:
        16 - 0100 GT Indicator and Route on GT
        80 - 0100 GT Indicator and Route on PC + SSN
        Even when SCCP stack works in ANSI mode Address Indicator
        value for CLI and GUI must have values that we use for
        ITU-T mode.
    <point-code>    -    MTP Signaling Point Code.
        This parameter contains a point code to which message will
        be routed after GTT (DPC field).
        This parameter is mandatory.
    <subsystem-number>  -   This parameter contains SSN which will be placed
        into CalledPartyAddress. If you set this parameter to "0",
        SSN from CalledPartyAddress of an original message will be
        put into CalledPartyAddress.
    <translation-type>    -    This is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000 or 0001.
        TRANSLATION TYPE VALUES
        Value           Description
        ----------------------------------
        0              Unknown
        1 - 63         International Service
        64 - 127       Spare
        128 - 254      National Network Specific
        255            Reserved for Expansion
        Value of this parameter will be placed into
        CalledPartyAddress. This parameter is mandatory if GT
        Indicator suppose this parameter is included into GT.
        Most used value: 0 - translation-type - Unknown
    <numbering-plan>    -    The Number Plan (NP) field specifies the numbering
        plan which the address information follows. This
        is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000, 0001 or 0010.
        Value of this parameter will be placed into
        CalledPartyAddress. This parameter is mandatory if GT
        Indicator suppose this parameter is included into GT.
        Most used value: 1 - numbering-plan - ISDN/telephony
    <nature-of-address> -    The Nature of Address Indicator (NAI) field
        defines the address range for a specific numbering
        plan. This is only used if GT Indicator is 0100.
        Value of this parameter will be placed into
        CalledPartyAddress. This parameter is mandatory if GT
        Indicator suppose this parameter is included into GT.
        Most used value: 4 - nature-of-address - International
    <digits>    -    The global title address information to translate
        to. Specified as string of digits divided into
        subsections using separator '/' depending on if
        the mask contains separator or not.
        The digits string can contain:
        DIGIT PATTERN
        Value           Description
        ----------------------------------
        -       padding - ignored
        /       separator used to split the digit
                pattern into sections.
                Each section is processed
                differently as specified by the
                mask parameter in the
                'sccp rule create' command.
                We need this parameter if at least one section of Rule
                mask contains "R" (replace) value. Else set this field
                to "0". If this field is needed it should contain the
                same subsections as the rule mask has.
    <stack-name>    -    Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
        If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor will be used.
