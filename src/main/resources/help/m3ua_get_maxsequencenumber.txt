    m3ua get maxsequencenumber
SYNOPSIS
    m3ua get maxsequencenumber stackname <stack-name>
DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to retrieve the current settings of the parameter
    'maxsequencenumber'. The 'maxsequencenumber' parameter is used to specify
    the maximum sequence number used for load-balancing algorithm.
    Sequence number or Signalling Link Selection (SLS) is used for load-balancing
    between ASPs in AS and also between various AS for the same point-code.
    The parameter 'maxsequencenumber' controls the maximum SLS that should be
    used for this. It is safe to leave it at 256.
    The settings can be modified only when the M3UA Stack is not running.
    To modify this parameter you must invoke the setter function
    directly from the code or if you are using the JBoss AS, you can add a
    property to the XML descriptor file jboss-beans.xml. You cannot change the
    settings through the CLI.
